# Caesar Cipher

## Project Description

Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding, and decoding.
The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z).
The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A).
So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC".
